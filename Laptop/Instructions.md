Download the 7z file and extract the Grumium folder to the /home/$user/.config/conky folder.  
If installed, run [conky-manager2](https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/07/install-conky-manager-ubuntu-20-04-lts/) and use that to enable the conky theme.  
If not, run ./start.sh in the Grumium folder.
